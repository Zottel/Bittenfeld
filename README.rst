Work in progress!

Not functional.

IRC Bot in Haskell


Current State
=============

- Minimal connection handling was taken from https://wiki.haskell.org/Roll_your_own_IRC_bot

- Own implementation:
  - IRC message parser in AttoParsec with unit tests.


Next Steps
==========

- Decide on general architecture, is the one from Design.rst feasible in Haskell?  Do we handle connection termination and setup correctly, are we missing some possible security issues?
